- Sublime Text must be installed on the system.

### Instructions

- Add some tags to your files (as commments in programs) eg: #math #graph #prime etc.
- You can change the default search directory in line 30 of the code.
- Compile this code and run the executable file produced.
- Rename the executable to search.exe and copy it into the System32 folder. (Recommended)
